use of loadbalancer.
A load balancer, in simple terms, is like a traffic cop for internet traffic. Its main job is to evenly distribute incoming visitors or requests to different servers or computers. Imagine it as a way to keep everything running smoothly and prevent one server from getting overwhelmed.

Here's how it works:

Traffic Distribution: When you have a website or online service, lots of people want to access it. Instead of sending all these requests to a single server, a load balancer spreads the requests across multiple servers. It's like having multiple cash registers open at a store during a sale to serve customers faster.

Even Workload: The load balancer makes sure that each server gets a similar amount of work. Think of it like the traffic cop making sure each lane of a road has an equal number of cars. This keeps your website or service running smoothly without any one server getting too busy.
